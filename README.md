```

2. Interactive mode with verbose output:
```bash

```

## Exit Codes

The script uses different exit codes to indicate various states:

- `0`: Everything is clean (no issues)
- `1`: Script error or invalid usage
- `2`: Protected branch warning
- `3`: Uncommitted changes or unpushed commits
- `4`: Branch needs pulling (behind remote)
- `5`: Branches have diverged
- `6`: Other Git-related issues

## Color-Coded Output

The script uses color coding for better visibility:

- üü¢ Green: Success messages and completed actions
- üî¥ Red: Errors and critical issues
- üü° Yellow: Warnings and status notifications
- üîµ Blue: Information and progress messages

## Interactive Mode Flow

When running in interactive mode (-i), the script:

1. Checks current branch status
2. Detects any issues (uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, etc.)
3. Offers appropriate actions for each issue
4. Guides you through resolving each issue step by step
5. Confirms successful completion of actions

Example interaction:
```
